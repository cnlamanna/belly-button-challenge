# belly-button-challenge
### Deployed Page: https://cnlamanna.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

Challenge:
Building an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

- pushed folders to GitHub
- Remember to "deploy" once finished
- I had some time, so I will play around with the optional advanced challenge of a gauge chart. I pushed the finished challenge before working on this optional part.
- I was having too much trouble with the gauge chart. Every time I tried to run the new integrated code, the other charts would disappear. Would rather work on other assignments and get opinions on the optional gauge chart later.
- deploying site now.
