# belly-button-challenge
- pushed folders to GitHub
- Remember to "deploy" once finished
- I had some time, so I will play around with the optional advanced challenge of a gauge chart. I pushed the finished challenge before working on this optional part.
- I was having too much trouble with the gauge chart. Every time I tried to run the new integrated code, the other charts would disappear. Would rather work on other assignments and get opinions on the optional gauge chart later.
- deploying site now.
